Skeltrack Desktop Control
==========================

This demo is an example of what can be done with Skeltrack.

It needs a Kinect device, to which it connects using GFreenect, and retrieves
the head and hands' positions from Skeltrack. Then, the positions are
interpreted as gestures which are mapped to events in the desktop using Xlib.

This demo is not supposed to be a full-blown gesture interpretation system,
so, the code is tailored to use cases in the GNOME 3 desktop.

A video showing this demo in use can be watched at:

Gestures
========

The gestures are activated when the hands are at a certain distance in front
of the head (around 30 cm); this is called the "action area".

The following list shows what gestures are interpreted as commands:
1) One hand moving: Move mouse pointer;
2) While one hand is in the action area another one hand enters
   it and quickly leaves: Perform a click;
3) While one hand is in the action area another one hand enters and stays
   there: Perform a mouse press (allowing the user to move things around
   using the other hand);

Apart from the list above, there are two modes when both hands enter the
action area at about the same time. Those are:
1) Steering Wheel Mode: Both hands are interpreted as if holding a steering
   wheel. By default the up arrow key is pressed and the left or right arrow
   keys are pressed according to the orientation of the hands.
2) Pinch Mode: Both hands are interpreted as if performing a pinch gesture,
   which results in a control + mouse wheel up/down event (because
   this is usually interpreted as zoom in/out).
